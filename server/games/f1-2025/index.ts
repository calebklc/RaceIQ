CATEGORY GUIDELINES:
- "pace": 4-6 items covering speed, DRS usage, ERS deployment, throttle %, braking efficiency, full-throttle time, gear usage. Each with a concrete value.
- "handling": 4-6 items covering tyre temps, tyre wear balance (front/rear, left/right), oversteer/understeer, weight transfer, tyre compound degradation. Each with a concrete value.
- "corners": Top 3-5 problem corners where time is being lost. Include speed numbers.
- "technique": 3-5 actionable driving tips. Reference specific telemetry values. Consider DRS activation zones, ERS harvesting vs deployment, lift-and-coast for fuel/tyre saving, and tyre temperature management.
- "setup": 3-5 high-level setup changes. Always include the symptom from data and the specific fix. Consider front/rear wing balance, differential, brake bias, tyre pressures.
- "tuning": 4-8 specific component adjustments with concrete target values. Cover: front wing, rear wing, differential (on/off throttle), brake bias, tyre pressures, suspension geometry, anti-roll bars, ride height. Only include components where the data suggests a change is needed.

F1 25 SETUP RANGES — all tuning recommendations MUST use values within these ranges:

Aerodynamics:
  Front Wing Angle: 0–50
  Rear Wing Angle: 0–50

Transmission:
  Differential On-Throttle: 50%–100%
  Differential Off-Throttle: 50%–100%

Suspension Geometry:
  Front Camber: -3.50° to -2.50° (typical: -3.00° to -2.80°)
  Rear Camber: -2.00° to -1.00° (typical: -1.50° to -1.20°)
  Front Toe: 0.05° to 0.15° (toe-out, higher = more turn-in)
  Rear Toe: 0.20° to 0.50° (toe-in, higher = more rear stability)

Suspension (slider 1–11, where 1 = softest, 11 = stiffest):
  Front Suspension: 1–11 (typical: 3–7)
  Rear Suspension: 1–11 (typical: 1–5)
  Front Anti-Roll Bar: 1–11 (typical: 3–7)
  Rear Anti-Roll Bar: 1–11 (typical: 1–5)
  Front Ride Height: 1–50 (typical: 15–25, lower = more downforce but risks bottoming)
  Rear Ride Height: 1–50 (typical: 30–50, usually higher than front for rake)

Brakes:
  Brake Pressure: 50%–100% (typical: 90–100%)
  Front Brake Bias: 50%–70% (typical: 54–58%, lower = more rear braking)

Tyres:
  Front Right Tyre Pressure: 21.0–25.0 psi (typical: 23.5–24.5 psi)
  Front Left Tyre Pressure: 21.0–25.0 psi (typical: 23.5–24.5 psi)
  Rear Right Tyre Pressure: 19.5–23.5 psi (typical: 21.5–22.5 psi)
  Rear Left Tyre Pressure: 19.5–23.5 psi (typical: 21.5–22.5 psi)

F1-SPECIFIC RULES:
- ALL tuning values MUST be within the ranges above — never recommend values outside these limits
- Use the exact component names listed above in the "tuning" section
- When CURRENT CAR SETUP data is provided, use the actual values as "current" in the tuning section — do NOT recommend fuel changes
- The "current" field in tuning MUST show the actual setup value (e.g. "Front Wing: 7"), "target" MUST be a specific number
- Consider DRS availability and whether it was used optimally in DRS zones
- Factor in ERS deployment strategy — was energy used in the right places?
- Consider tyre compound characteristics (soft/medium/hard) and degradation patterns
- Weather conditions affect grip levels and optimal driving lines
- Front and rear wing balance is critical for F1 aero setup
- Reference specific numbers from the data — don't be vague
- Be specific and actionable, not generic
- Address the driver as "you"
- Output ONLY valid JSON, nothing else`;
