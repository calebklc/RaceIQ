RaceIQ is the most advanced sim racing telemetry app available — and it's completely free. Whether you're chasing lap records, finding fast tunes, or just trying to understand why you're slow through turn 3, RaceIQ gives you tools that simply aren't available anywhere else.

It captures telemetry from your racing games, records every lap to a local database, and gives you a full dashboard with live data, lap comparison, AI coaching, and 3D visualizations — all running locally on your PC.

## Features

- **Live telemetry** — real-time dashboard with speed, inputs, tires, suspension, G-forces, and 3D car visualization
- **Track mapping** — 70+ built-in circuits with live car position and automatic track learning
- **Lap analysis** — automatic lap and corner detection, side-by-side comparison with time deltas
- **AI coaching** — send any lap for AI-powered technique, setup, and tire feedback
- **Vehicle setup** — tune catalog, setup editor, and car browser with performance history
- **Tune analysis** — compare the fastest tunes and see popular setting ranges across the community
- **Driver profiles** — multiple profiles, lap export, and aggregate stats

## Supported Games

| Game | Cars | Tunes |
|------|------|-------|
| Forza Motorsport 2023 | Yes | No |
| F1 2025 | Yes | Yes |
| Assetto Corsa Competizione | Yes | Yes |

## Getting Started

### 1. Download

Grab the latest installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/SpeedHQ/RaceIQ/releases/latest) and run it.

### 2. Run and Connect

Open RaceIQ and follow the setup wizard. Configure your game's telemetry settings to send UDP data to `127.0.0.1:5301`, then start a race — telemetry will appear automatically.

> **Already forwarding telemetry to a wheel base or other app?** Use [UDP Forwarder](https://github.com/SpeedHQ/udp-forwarder) to send telemetry to multiple destinations at once.

## Platform

**Windows is required.** RaceIQ runs on the same PC as the game for two reasons:

- **UDP reliability** — loopback delivery is lossless and low-latency, avoiding the packet loss and timing jitter of network routing.
- **Shared memory** — some games (like ACC) expose richer telemetry via shared memory, which requires running on the same machine.

## Data Storage

All data stays on your machine in a `data/` folder next to the executable:

- **Database** — every lap, session, analysis, tune, and profile stored in SQLite
- **Settings** — UDP port, units, active profile, and thresholds

The database is created automatically on first run. No cloud account or external service required.

## AI Coaching Setup

AI analysis is optional. Add your API key in the RaceIQ settings panel — multiple providers are supported. Analysis is sent directly to the provider's API, no intermediary server.

## Contributing

RaceIQ is a community project and every contribution helps — whether that's code, car/track data, tune setups, bug reports, or just telling a friend about it. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development setup, architecture, and how to add support for new games.
